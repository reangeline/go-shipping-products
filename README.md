# üì¶ Shipping Products

This project solves the pack calculation problem.
Given an order with a quantity of items, the system returns the best combination of available packs, minimizing the total number of items and packages.

# üîë Features

- **API HTTP** in Go (clean architecture):
  - `GET /v1/packsizes` ‚Üí lists the configured pack sizes.
  - `POST /v1/calculate` ‚Üí calculates the optimal combination for an order.
- **Frontend React**:
  - Displays the available pack sizes.
  - Allows calculating packages for an order and visualizing the result.

# ‚úèÔ∏è Logic proccess to development
1.	I used Clean Architecture and started by creating the core with all the business logic.
1.1 First, I built the order.go entity, which handles the order quantity requested by the customer.
1.2 Then I created pack.go, which defines the fixed (immutable) pack sizes.
1.3 In both cases, I added a simple rule: the values must always be greater than zero and wrote tests for them.
1.4 After that, I worked on the most important part ‚Äî the calculator.
1.4.1 The calculator takes the order quantity and the list of available packs, and applies the algorithm to find the best combination.
1.4.2 The algorithm works with the pack sizes and the target quantity, and is optimized using GCD.
1.4.3 While creating the calculator, I used Table-Driven Tests to validate the whole process.

2.	After the domain, I created ports/inbound/order for my use case contracts.
2.1 Next, I created outbound/packagesizes with a provider interface to list values. In this case, I could also add a repository interface to fetch values from a database.

3.	Then I implemented my use cases and finished my core application.

4.	For adapters, I followed the same logic with inbound and outbound. Nothing special ‚Äî the main difference was abstracting the Gin framework so it can be replaced by others.
4.1 I created external communication using HTTP, but this could also be gRPC, CLI, GraphQL, etc.
4.2 In outbound, I created packsizes/file provider to read from a CSV file. I could also use an env provider (to read from environment variables) or a repository provider (to read from a database). This is the external dependency of my use cases.
4.3 I added documentation using Swagger (OpenAPI) for the app.

5.	Finally, I created the wiring to handle dependency injection.
6.	I built a simple frontend using React + Vite.
7.	And the Dockerfiles/docker-compose to run the whole project.
